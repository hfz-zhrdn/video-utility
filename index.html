        <h1>Lattice Video Timing & MIPI Configuration Calculator</h1>
        <p>
          This comprehensive tool helps FPGA/SoC designers calculate video
          timing parameters, MIPI D-PHY configurations, and bandwidth
          requirements for Lattice Semiconductor devices. Streamline your design
          process with accurate calculations and industry-standard presets.

            and Lattice device specifications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Results provide engineering estimates based on standard MIPI D-PHY
            specifications; hardware validation and Lattice Radiant verification
            are recommended.
          </li>
          <li>
            Device-specific line rate ranges are based on Lattice device
            capabilities; consult the latest device documentation for production
